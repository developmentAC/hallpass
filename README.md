## 🎮 Introduction

**Hall Pass** puts you in the sneakers of a student trying to survive and thrive through a day at school. Will you ace the pop quiz, pull off a daring milk heist, or challenge the principal to a showdown? You are trying to maintain your popularity, money, and grades, in addition to trying to impress the lovely Charlotte, the (potential) love of your life! Every event is random, every choice matters, and your stats (popularity, money, grades) are always on the line!
